# an example check_pycurl runfile to log in to a roundcube webmail server
#
# in the global variables at the top the cookiejar is enabled (this is a
# feature of curl / pycurl to store cookies between requests, check_pycurl
# will create this under /tmp and automatically remove it when done)
#
# the main test has 3 steps:
# 0 get login page (and retrieve token for storage)
# 1 post to login page
# 2 retrieve inbox page
#
# step 0 has a test regex that stores the token
# step 1 includes the postdata item that contains all the POST fields
# notably this includes a special field for _token, PREV_MATCH_0_1
# This uses the match object from step 0, group match 1 (group match 0
# would be the whole match object
# step 3 just does a simple check on the inbox url to check if
# successfully logged in
